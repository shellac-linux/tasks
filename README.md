# Tasks

These are the tasks being worked on by the shellac team. Everyone can submit issues but they have to be approved before being officially endorsed by the team (however, feel free to start working on the issue). You can upvote or downvote issues using the thumbs up/down feature of Github. The votes will influence which task are being worked when slots become available. (Only 5 active tasks at any given time for the moment, marked with the 'active' label).
